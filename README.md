Solve nonlinear eigenvalue problems, especially for Laplace eigenvalues with AAA.

TODOS:
- put the paper
- put in the dependencies NLEVP, and Chebfun
- test the test cases to see that they actually work with this code.
- The butterfly CD player, and the low frequency examples with the kite and circle
- will suffice I think.
