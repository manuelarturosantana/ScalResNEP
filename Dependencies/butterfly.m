function [coeffs,fun,F] = butterfly(n,c)
%BUTTERFLY  Quartic matrix polynomial with T-even structure.
%  [COEFFS,FUN,F] = nlevp('butterfly',N,C) generates the coefficient matrices
%  of an M^2-by-M^2 quartic matrix polynomial
%  P(lambda) = lambda^4*A_4 + lambda^2*A_3 + lambda^2*A_2 + lambda*A_1 + A_0
%  for which A_4 and A_2 are real and symmetric and
%  A_3 and A_1 are real and skew-symmetric (assuming C is real).
%  M is chosen such that M^2 approximates N.
%  The spectrum has a butterfly shape.
%  The default is N = 64.  C is an 10-by-1 vector of parameters.
%  The matrices are returned in a cell array: COEFFS = {A0, A1, A2, A3, A4}.
%  FUN is a function handle to evaluate the monomials 1,lambda,...,lambda^4
%  and their derivatives.
%  F is the function handle: lambda^4*A_4 + lambda^2*A_3 +
%  lambda^2*A_2 + lambda*A_1 + A_0.
%  This problem has the properties pep, real, parameter-dependent, T-even,
%  scalable, sparse, banded (8 bands).
